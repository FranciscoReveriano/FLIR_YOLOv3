Repository for managing truth and algorithm declarations for the ATLAS project.

To use the MATLAB version, navigate to the matlab folder and run the atlasScorerPath.m helper function or add the directory (& subdirectories) to the path.

For python installation instructions, navigate to the README in the python directory.

Some scripts are available in the testing folder, which should show some examples of the MATLAB code being used. Also, see the examples in the matlab\examples folder.  Note that you will need to set up the first part of that script to point to .decl and .truth files available on your system.
